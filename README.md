# Astar_algorithm
Implimenting A* algorithm for Robot planning course
Libraries used:
* numpy
* pygame
1. Install them using ```pip3 install pygame```

## Instructions to run
1. Open and run the script file corresponding to the A-Star algorithm : 'a_star_saksham_shyam_vedant.py'. You'll be prompted to enter inputs in the below given order.
2. Enter the sum of wall clearance and robot radius as a number (for eg. 10)
3. Enter the step size (for eg. 10)
4. Enter the goal and start state as a list of x, y, theta (in degrees) separated by commas (for eg: 10,10,0)
5. For points 2 and 3, if a non-number input is entered, the program keeps prompting till a number input is entered.
6. For point 4, the program keeps prompting till the start and goal states are entered in the proper manner suggested, and if the goal/start state is inside any of the obstacles' space.
